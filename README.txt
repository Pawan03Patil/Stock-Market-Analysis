Assumption:
As the SPY stock data begins from Jan 1993, we could not get SMA for the first 10 months 
of 1993 as SMA requires 10 previous values to get current SMA.
Hence, we have made the assumption that for strategy 2, we will put 1000$ in a 
savings account for the first 9 months of 1993 and from the 10th month onwards, use the
SMA to make investing choices according to strategy 2.
